'''Sponges''' are [[animal]]s of the [[phylum]] '''Porifera''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|p|ɒ|ˈ|r|ɪ|f|ər|ə}}; meaning "pore bearer"). They are multicellular organisms which have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like [[mesohyl]] sandwiched between two thin layers of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s.
Sponges have unspecialized cells that can transform into other types and which often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have [[nervous system|nervous]], [[digestive system|digestive]] or [[circulatory system]]s. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food, oxygen and remove wastes.

==Overview==
Sponges are like other animals in that they are multicellular, heterotrophic, lack cell walls and produce sperm cells. Unlike other animals, they lack true tissues and organs, and have no body symmetry. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where it deposits nutrients, and leaves through a hole called the [[osculum]]. Many sponges have internal skeletons of spongin and/or spicules of calcium carbonate or silica. All sponges are [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] aquatic animals. Although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt water) species, ranging from tidal zones to depths exceeding {{convert|8800|m|mi|abbr=on}}.

While most of the approximately 5,000–10,000&nbsp;known species feed on [[bacteria]] and other food particles in the water, some host [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] micro-organisms as [[endosymbiont]]s and these alliances often produce more food and oxygen than they consume. A few species of sponge that live in food-poor environments have become [[carnivore]]s that prey mainly  on small [[crustacean]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00435-004-0100-0 | author=J. Vacelet and E. Duport | title=Prey capture and digestion in the carnivorous sponge Asbestopluma hypogea (Porifera: Demospongiae)|year=2004|journal=Zoomorphology|volume=123|issue=4|pages=179}}</ref>

Most species use [[sexual reproduction]], releasing [[sperm]] cells into the water to fertilize [[ovum|ova]] that in some species are released and in others are retained by the "mother". The fertilized eggs form [[larva]]e which swim off in search of places to settle. Sponges are known for regenerating from fragments that are broken off, although this only works if the fragments include the right types of cells. A few species reproduce by budding. When conditions deteriorate, for example as temperatures drop, many freshwater species and a few marine ones produce [[gemmule]]s, "survival pods" of unspecialized cells that remain dormant until conditions improve and then either form completely new sponges or recolonize the skeletons of their parents.

The mesohyl functions as an [[endoskeleton]] in most sponges, and is the only skeleton in soft sponges that encrust hard surfaces such as rocks. More commonly, the mesohyl is stiffened by [[Biomineralization|mineral]] [[sponge spicule|spicules]], by [[spongin]] fibers or both. [[Demosponge]]s use spongin, and in many species, [[silica]] spicules and in some species, [[calcium carbonate]] [[exoskeleton]]s. Demosponges constitute about 90% of all known sponge species, including all freshwater ones, and have the widest range of habitats. [[Calcareous sponge]]s, which have calcium carbonate spicules and, in some species, calcium carbonate exoskeletons, are restricted to relatively shallow marine waters where production of calcium carbonate is easiest. The fragile [[glass sponge]]s, with "[[scaffolding]]" of silica spicules, are restricted to polar regions and the ocean depths where predators are rare. Fossils of all of these types have been found in rocks dated from {{ma|580}}. In addition [[Archaeocyathid]]s, whose fossils are common in rocks from {{ma|530|490}}, are now regarded as a type of sponge.

The sponge's closest [[unicellular|single-celled]] relatives are thought to be [[choanoflagellate]]s, which strongly resemble the cells sponges use to drive their water flow systems and capture most of their food. Sponges are generally agreed, also, to not form a [[monophyletic]] group, in other words do not include ''all and only'' the descendants of a common ancestor, because [[Eumetazoa]] (more complex animals) are thought to be descendants of a subgroup of sponges. However it is uncertain which group of sponges is closest to Eumetazoa, as both calcareous sponges and a subgroup of demosponges called [[Homoscleromorpha]] have been nominated by different researchers. In addition, a study in 2008 suggested the earliest animals may have been similar to modern [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]].

The few species of demosponge that have entirely soft fibrous skeletons with no hard elements have been used by humans over thousands of years for several purposes, including as padding and as cleaning tools. By the 1950s, though, these had been overfished so heavily that the industry almost collapsed, and most sponge-like materials are now synthetic. Sponges and their microscopic endosymbionts are now being researched as possible sources of medicines for treating a wide range of diseases. Dolphins have been observed using sponges as tools while foraging.

==Distinguishing features==

Sponges  constitute the [[phylum]] Porifera, and have been defined as [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[metazoa]]ns (multi-celled animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with [[choanocyte]]s, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes.<ref name="HooperVanSoestDebrenne2002PhylumPorifera">{{Cite book

===Cell types===
{{Annotated image/Porifera cell types}}
A sponge's body is hollow and is held in shape by the [[mesohyl]], a jelly-like substance made mainly of [[collagen]] and reinforced by a dense network of fibers also made of collagen. The inner surface is covered with [[choanocyte]]s, cells with cylindrical or conical collars surrounding one [[flagellum]] per choanocyte. The wave-like motion of the whip-like flagella drives water through the sponge's body. All sponges have [[wikt:ostium|ostia]], channels leading to the interior through the mesohyl, and in most sponges these are controlled by tube-like [[porocytes]] that form closable inlet valves. [[Pinacocyte]]s, plate-like cells, form a single-layered external skin over all other parts of the mesohyl that are not covered by choanocytes, and the pinacocytes also digest food particles that are too large to enter the ostia,<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera"/><ref name="Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson" /> while those at the base of the animal are responsible for anchoring it.<ref name="Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson" />

Other types of cell live and move within the mesohyl:<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /><ref name="Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson" />
*[[Lophocyte]]s are [[amoeba]]-like cells that move slowly through the mesohyl and secrete collagen fibres.
*[[Collencyte]]s are another type of collagen-producing cell.
*[[Rhabdiferous]] cells secrete [[polysaccharide]]s that also form part of the mesohyl.
*[[Oocyte]]s and [[spermatocyte]]s are reproductive cells.
*[[Sclerocyte]]s secrete the mineralized [[sponge spicule|spicules]] ("little spines") that form the [[skeleton]]s of many sponges and in some species provide some defense against predators.
*In addition to or instead of sclerocytes, [[demosponge]]s have [[spongocyte]]s that secrete a form of collagen that [[polymer]]izes into [[spongin]], a thick fibrous material that stiffens the mesohyl.
*[[Myocyte]]s ("muscle cells") conduct signals and cause parts of the animal to contract.
*"Grey cells" act as sponges' equivalent of an [[immune system]].
*[[Archaeocytes]] (or [[amoebocytes]]) are [[amoeba]]-like cells that are [[totipotent]], in other words each is capable of transformation into any other type of cell. They also have important roles in feeding and in clearing debris that block the ostia.

===Glass sponges' syncytia===
{{Annotated image/Euplectella | float=left}}
[[Glass sponge]]s present a distinctive variation on this basic plan. Their spicules, which are made of [[silica]], form a [[scaffolding]]-like framework between whose rods the living tissue is suspended like a [[Spider web|cobweb]] that contains most of the cell types.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> This tissue is a [[syncytium]] that in some ways behaves like many cells that share a single external [[Cell membrane|membrane]], and in others like a single cell with multiple [[cell nucleus|nuclei]]. The mesohyl is absent or minimal.  The syncytium's [[cytoplasm]], the soupy fluid that fills the interiors of cells, is organized into "rivers" that transport nuclei, [[organelle]]s ("organs" within cells) and other substances.<ref name="Leys2003SignificanceOfSyncytialTissues">{{Cite journal

}}</ref> Instead of choanocytes they have further syncytia, known as choanosyncytia, which form bell-shaped chambers which water enters via perforations. The insides of these chambers are lined with "collar bodies", each consisting of a collar and flagellum but without a nucleus of its own. The motion of the flagella sucks water through passages in the "cobweb" and expels it via the open ends of the bell-shaped chambers.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" />

Some types of cells have a single nucleus and membrane each, but are connected to other single-nucleus cells and to the main syncytium by "bridges" made of [[cytoplasm]]. The [[sclerocyte]]s that build spicules have multiple nuclei, and in glass sponge larvae they are connected to other tissues by cytoplasm bridges; such connections between sclerocytes have not so far been found in adults, but this may simply reflect the difficulty of investigating such small-scale features. The bridges are controlled by "plugged junctions" that apparently permit some substances to pass while blocking others.<ref name="Leys2003SignificanceOfSyncytialTissues" />

===Water flow and body structures===
{{Annotated image/Porifera body structures}}
Most sponges work rather like [[chimney]]s: they take in water at the bottom and eject it from the [[osculum]] ("little mouth") at the top. Since ambient currents are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the beat of the flagella, and may shut it down if there is a lot of sand or silt in the water.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" />

Although the layers of [[pinacocyte]]s and [[choanocyte]]s resemble the [[epithelia]] of more complex animals, they are not bound tightly by cell-to-cell connections or a basal lamina (thin fibrous sheet underneath). The flexibility of these layers and re-modeling of the mesohyl by lophocytes allow the animals to adjust their shapes throughout their lives to take maximum advantage of local water currents.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" />

The simplest body structure in sponges is a tube or vase shape known as "asconoid", but this severely limits the size of the animal. The body structure is characterized by a stalk-like spongocoel surrounded by a single layer of choanocytes.  If it is simply scaled up, the ratio of its volume to surface area increases, because surface increases as the square of length or width while volume increases proportionally to the cube. The amount of tissue that needs food and [[oxygen]] is determined by the volume, but the pumping capacity that supplies food and oxygen depends on the area covered by choanocytes. Asconoid sponges seldom exceed {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" />

Some sponges overcome this limitation by adopting the "[[syconoid]]" structure, in which the body wall is [[pleat]]ed. The inner pockets of the pleats are lined with choanocytes, which connect to the outer pockets of the pleats by ostia. This increase in the number of choanocytes and hence in pumping capacity enables syconoid sponges to grow up to a few centimeters in diameter. The "leuconid" pattern boosts pumping capacity further by filling the interior almost completely with mesohyl that contains a network of chambers lined with choanocytes and connected to each other and to the water intakes and outlet by tubes. Leuconid sponges grow to over {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, and the fact that growth in any direction increases the number of choanocyte chambers enables them to take a wider range of forms, for example "encrusting" sponges whose shapes follow those of the surfaces to which they attach. All freshwater and most shallow-water marine sponges have leuconid bodies. The networks of water passages in [[glass sponge]]s are similar to the leuconid structure.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" />
In all three types of structure the cross-section area of the choanocyte-lined regions is much greater than that of the intake and outlet channels. This makes the flow slower near the choanocytes and thus makes it easier for them to trap food particles.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> For example in ''[[Leuconia]]'', a small leuconoid sponge about {{convert|10|cm|in}} tall and {{convert|1|cm|in}} in diameter, water enters each of more than 80,000 intake canals at 6&nbsp;cm per ''minute''. However, because ''Leuconia'' has more than 2&nbsp;million flagellated chambers whose combined diameter is much greater than that of the canals, water flow through chambers slows to 3.6&nbsp;cm per ''hour'', making it easy for choanocytes to capture food. All the water is expelled through a single [[osculum]] at about 8.5&nbsp;cm per ''second'', fast enough to carry waste products some distance away.<ref>{{Cite book

===Skeleton===
In zoology a [[skeleton]] is any fairly rigid structure of an animal, irrespective of whether it has joints and irrespective of whether it is [[biomineralization|biomineralized]]. The mesohyl functions as an [[endoskeleton]] in most sponges, and is the only skeleton in soft sponges that encrust hard surfaces such as rocks. More commonly the mesohyl is stiffened by mineral [[sponge spicule|spicules]], by [[spongin]] fibers or both. Spicules may be made of [[silica]] or [[calcium carbonate]], and vary in shape from simple rods to three-dimensional "stars" with up to six rays. Spicules are produced by [[sclerocyte]] cells,<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> and may be separate, connected by joints, or fused.<ref name="HooperVanSoestDebrenne2002PhylumPorifera" />

Some sponges also secrete [[exoskeleton]]s that lie completely outside their organic components. For example [[sclerosponge]]s ("hard sponges") have massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons over which the organic matter forms a thin layer with [[choanocyte]] chambers in pits in the mineral. These exoskeletons are secreted by the [[pinacocyte]]s that form the animals' skins.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" />

==Classes==

Sponges were traditionally distributed in three classes: calcareous sponges (Calcarea), glass sponges (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, studies have shown that the [[Homoscleromorpha]], a group thought to belong to the [[Demospongiae]], is actually phylogenetically well separated. Therefore, they have recently been recognized as the fourth class of sponges.<ref name="Gazave2010">Gazave E, Lapébie P, Renard E, Vacelet J, Rocher C, Ereskovsky AV, Lavrov DV, Borchiellini C (2010) Molecular phylogeny restores the supra-generic subdivision of homoscleromorph sponges (porifera, homoscleromorpha).

==Vital functions==
[[File:Spongia officinalis.jpg| thumb | right | 200px | ''[[Spongia officinalis]]'', "the kitchen sponge", is dark grey when alive]]

===Movement===
Although adult sponges are fundamentally [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] animals, some marine and freshwater species can move across the sea bed at speeds of {{convert|1|-|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} per day, as a result of [[amoeba (genus)|amoeba]]-like movements of [[pinacocyte]]s and other cells. A few species can contract their whole bodies, and many can close their [[osculum|oscula]] and [[wikt:ostium|ostia]]. Juveniles drift or swim freely, while adults are stationary.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" />

===Respiration, feeding and excretion===
Sponges do not have distinct [[circulatory]], [[respiratory]], [[digestion|digestive]], and [[excretory]] systems – instead the water flow system supports all these functions. They [[filter feeding|filter]] food particles out of the water flowing through them also called intracellular digestion. Particles larger than 50&nbsp;micrometers cannot enter the [[wikt:ostium|ostia]] and [[pinacocyte]]s consume them by [[phagocytosis]] (engulfing and internal digestion). Particles from 0.5&nbsp;μm to 50&nbsp;μm are trapped in the ostia, which taper from the outer to inner ends. These particles are consumed by pinacocytes or by [[archaeocyte]]s which partially extrude themselves through the walls of the ostia. Bacteria-sized particles, below 0.5&nbsp;micrometers, pass through the ostia and are caught and consumed by [[choanocyte]]s.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> Since the smallest particles are by far the most common, choanocytes typically capture 80% of a sponge's food supply.<ref name="Bergquist2001InEncOfLifeSci">{{Cite book

Sponges' cells absorb oxygen by [[diffusion]] from water into cells as water flows through body, into which [[carbon dioxide]] and other soluble waste products such as [[ammonia]] also diffuse.

===Endosymbionts===
Freshwater sponges often host [[green algae]] as [[endosymbiont]]s within [[archaeocyte]]s and other cells, and benefit from nutrients produced by the algae. Many marine species host other [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] organisms, most commonly [[cyanobacteria]] but in some cases [[dinoflagellate]]s. Symbiotic cyanobacteria may form a third of  the total mass of living tissue in some sponges, and some sponges gain 48% to 80% of their energy supply from these micro-organisms.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> In 2008 a [[University of Stuttgart]] team reported that [[spicule]]s made of [[silica]] conduct light into the [[mesohyl]], where the photosynthesizing endosymbionts live.<ref>News report at {{cite journal

A recently-discovered carnivorous sponge that lives near [[hydrothermal vent]]s hosts [[Methanotrophic|methane-eating]] bacteria, and digests some of them.<ref name="Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson" />

==="Immune" system===
Sponges do not have the complex [[immune system]]s of most other animals.  However they reject [[Medical grafting|grafts]] from other species but accept them from other members of their own species.  In a few marine species, gray cells play the leading role in rejection of foreign material.  When invaded, they produce a chemical that stops movement of other cells in the affected area, thus preventing the intruder from using the sponge's internal transport systems.  If the intrusion persists, the grey cells concentrate in the area and release toxins that kill all cells in the area. The "immune" system can stay in this activated state for up to three weeks.<ref name="Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson" />

===Reproduction===
====Asexual====
[[File:Spongilla lacustris.jpg| thumb | right | 200px | The freshwater sponge ''[[Spongilla lacustris]]'']]
Sponges have three [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] methods of reproduction: after fragmentation; by [[budding]]; and by producing [[gemmule]]s. Fragments of sponges may be detached by currents or waves. They use the mobility of their [[pinacocyte]]s and [[choanocyte]]s and reshaping of the [[mesohyl]] to re-attach themselves to a suitable surface and then rebuild themselves as small but functional sponges over the course of several days. The same capabilities enable sponges that have been squeezed through a fine cloth to regenerate.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> A sponge fragment can only regenerate if it contains both [[collencyte]]s to produce [[mesohyl]] and [[archeocyte]]s to produce all the other cell types.<ref name="Bergquist2001InEncOfLifeSci" /> A very few species reproduce by budding.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" />

Gemmules are "survival pods" which a few marine sponges and many freshwater species produce by the thousands when dying and which some, mainly freshwater species, regularly produce in autumn. [[Spongocyte]]s make gemmules by wrapping shells of [[spongin]], often reinforced with [[spicule]]s, round clusters of [[archeocyte]]s that are full of nutrients.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> Freshwater gemmules may also include phytosynthesizing symbionts.<ref name="SmithPennak2001FreshwaterInvertebrates">{{cite book

| accessdate=2008-10-31
}}</ref> The gemmules then become dormant, and in this state can survive cold, drying out, lack of oxygen and extreme variations in [[salinity]].<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> Freshwater gemmules often do not revive until the temperature drops, stays cold for a few months and then reaches a near-"normal" level.<ref name="SmithPennak2001FreshwaterInvertebrates" /> When a gemmule germinates, the archeocytes round the outside of the cluster transform into [[pinacocyte]]s, a membrane over a pore in the shell bursts, the cluster of cells slowly emerges, and most of the remaining archeocytes transform into other cell types needed to make a functioning sponge. Gemmules from the same species but different individuals can join forces to form one sponge.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> Some gemmules are retained within the parent sponge, and in spring it can be difficult to tell whether an old sponge has revived or been "recolonized" by its own gemmules.<ref name="SmithPennak2001FreshwaterInvertebrates" />

====Sexual====
Most sponges are [[hermaphrodite]]s (function as both sexes simultaneously), although sponges have no [[gonad]]s (reproductive organs). Sperm are produced by [[choanocyte]]s or entire choanocyte chambers that sink into the [[mesohyl]] and form spermatic [[cyst]]s while eggs are formed by transformation of [[archeocyte]]s, or of choanocytes in some species. Each egg generally acquires a [[yolk]] by consuming "nurse cells". During spawning, sperm burst out of their cysts and are expelled via the [[osculum]]. If they contact another sponge of the same species, the water flow carries them to choanocytes that engulf them but, instead of digesting them, metamorphose to an [[ameboid]] form and carry the sperm through the mesohyl to eggs, which in most cases engulf the carrier and its cargo.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" />

A few species release fertilized eggs into the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are four types of larvae, but all are balls of cells with an outer layer of cells whose [[flagella]]e or [[cilia]] enable the larvae to move. After swimming for a few days the larvae sink and crawl until they find a place to settle. Most of the cells transform into archeocytes and then into the types appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" />

[[Glass sponge]] embryos start by dividing into separate cells, but once 32&nbsp;cells have formed they rapidly transform into larvae that externally are [[ovoid]] with a band of [[cilia]] round the middle that they use for movement, but internally have the typical glass sponge structure of spicules with a cobweb-like main [[syncitium]] draped around and between them and [[choanosyncytia]] with multiple collar bodies in  the center. The larvae then leave their parents' bodies.<ref>{{cite journal

| pmid=21672727
}}</ref>

====Life cycle====
Sponges in [[temperate]] regions live for at most a few years, but some [[Tropics|tropical]] species and perhaps some deep-ocean ones may live for 200&nbsp;years or more. Some calcified [[demosponge]]s grow by only {{convert|0.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year and, if that rate is constant, specimens {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide must be about 5,000&nbsp;years old. Some sponges start sexual reproduction when only a few weeks old, while others wait until they are several years old.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" />

===Coordination of activities===
Adult sponges lack [[neuron]]s or any other kind of [[nervous tissue]]. However most species have the ability to perform movements that are coordinated all over their bodies, mainly contractions of the [[pinacocyte]]s, squeezing the water channels and thus expelling excess sediment and other substances that may cause blockages. Some species can contract the [[osculum]] independently of the rest of the body. Sponges may also contract in order to reduce the area that is vulnerable to attack by predators. In cases where two sponges are fused, for example if there is a large but still unseparated bud, these contraction waves slowly become coordinated in both of the "[[Siamese twins]]". The coordinating mechanism is unknown, but may involve chemicals similar to [[neurotransmitter]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

| pmid=15579547
| issue=Pt 26
}}</ref> However [[glass sponge]]s rapidly transmit electrical impulses through all parts of the [[syncytium]], and use this to halt the motion of their [[flagella]] if the incoming water contains toxins or excessive sediment.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> [[Myocyte]]s are thought to be responsible for closing the osculum and for transmitting signals between different parts of the body.<ref name="Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson" />

Sponges contain [[gene]]s very similar to those that contain the "recipe" for the post-[[synapse|synaptic]] density, an important signal-receiving structure in the neurons of all other animals. However in sponges these genes are only activated in "flask cells" that appear only in larvae and may provide some sensory capability while the larvae are swimming. This raises questions about whether flask cells represent the predecessors of true neurons or are evidence that sponges' ancestors had true neurons but lost them as they adapted to a sessile lifestyle.<ref>{{cite journal

<!--
Sponges have several cell types:
*[[Archaeocytes]] (or [[amoebocytes]]) have many functions;    they are [[totipotent]] cells which can transform into [[sclerocytes]], [[spongocytes]], or [[collencytes]]. They also have a role in nutrient transport and sexual reproduction.
*Cells are arranged in a gelatinous non-cellular [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] called mesohyll
Sponges have three body types: [[asconoid]], [[syconoid]], and [[leuconoid]].
*[[Choanocyte]]s (also known as "collar cells") function as the sponge's [[digestive system]], and are remarkably similar to the [[protist]]an [[choanoflagellate]]s.  The collars are composed of many [[Microvillus|microvilli]] and are used to filter particles out of the water. The beating of the choanocytes’ [[flagellum|flagella]] creates the sponge’s water current.
*[[Collencytes]] secrete [[collagen]].
*[[Myocytes (sponge)|Myocytes]] are modified pinacocytes which control the size of the osculum and pore openings and thus the water flow.
*[[Pinacocytes]] which form the [[pinacoderm]], the outer epidermal layer of cells.  This is the closest approach to true tissue in sponges
*[[Porocytes]] are tubular cells that make up the pores into the sponge body through the [[mesohyl]].
*[[Sclerocytes]] secrete [[calcareous]] siliceous spicules which reside in the mesohyl.
*[[Spongocytes]] secrete [[spongin]], [[collagen]]-like fibers which make up the mesohyl.
*[[Spicule]]s are stiffened rods or spikes made of [[calcium carbonate]] or [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] which are used for structure and [[antipredator adaptation|defense]].

===Habitats===
Sponges are worldwide in their distribution, from the polar regions to the tropics.<ref name="Bergquist2001InEncOfLifeSci" /> Most live in quiet, clear waters, because sediment stirred up by waves or currents would block their pores, making it difficult for them to feed and breathe.<ref name="Krautter1998EcologyOfSiliceousSponges" /> The greatest numbers of sponges are usually found on firm surfaces such as rocks, but some sponges can attach themselves to soft sediment by means of a root-like base.<ref>{{cite journal

===As primary producers===
Sponges with [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] [[endosymbiont]]s produce up to three times more [[oxygen]] than they consume, as well as more organic matter than they consume. Such contributions to their habitats' resources are significant along Australia's [[Great Barrier Reef]] but relatively minor in the Caribbean.<ref name="Bergquist2001InEncOfLifeSci" />

===Defenses===
[[File:BoredEncrustedShell.JPG|thumb|right|Holes made by clionaid sponge (producing the trace ''[[Entobia]]'') after the death of a modern bivalve shell of species ''[[Mercenaria mercenaria]]'', from [[North Carolina]]]]
[[File:Entobia Modern.jpg|thumb|Close-up of the sponge boring ''Entobia'' in a modern oyster valve. Note the chambers which are connected by short tunnels.]]
Many sponges shed [[spicule]]s, forming a dense carpet several meters deep that keeps away [[echinoderm]]s which would otherwise prey on the sponges.<ref name="Bergquist2001InEncOfLifeSci" /> They also produce toxins that prevent other sessile organisms such as [[bryozoa]]ns or [[sea squirt]]s from growing on or near them, making sponges very effective competitors for living space.  One of many examples includes [[ageliferin]].

A few species, such as the [[Caribbean]] fire sponge ''[[Tedania]] ignis'', cause a severe rash in humans who handle them.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It is often said that sponges produce chemical defenses against such predators.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> However an experiment showed that there is no relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.<ref name="Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson" />

[[Glass sponge]]s produce no toxic chemicals, and live in very deep water where predators are rare.<ref name="Krautter1998EcologyOfSiliceousSponges" />

===Predation===
Sponge flies, also known as spongilla-flies ([[Neuroptera]], [[Sisyridae]]), are specialist predators of freshwater sponges. The female lays her eggs on vegetation overhanging water. The larvae hatch and drop into the water where they seek out sponges to feed on. They use their elongated mouthparts to pierce the sponge and suck the fluids within. The larvae of some species cling to the surface of the sponge while others take refuge in the sponge's internal cavities. The fully grown larvae leave the water and spin a cocoon in which to pupate.<ref>[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Publishing Group]].</ref>

===Bioerosion===

The Caribbean chicken-liver sponge ''[[Chondrilla nucula]]'' secretes toxins that kill coral [[polyp]]s, allowing the sponges to grow over the coral skeletons.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> Others, especially in the family [[Clionaidae]], use corrosive substances secreted by their archeocytes to tunnel into rocks, corals and the shells of dead [[mollusk]]s.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> Sponges may remove up to {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} per year from reefs, creating visible notches just below low-tide level.<ref name="Bergquist2001InEncOfLifeSci" />

===Diseases===
Caribbean sponges of the genus ''[[Aplysina]]'' suffer from [[Aplysina red band syndrome]]. This causes ''Aplysina'' to develop one or more rust-colored bands, sometimes with adjacent bands of [[necrosis|necrotic]] tissue. These lesions may completely encircle branches of the sponge. The disease appears to be [[Contagious disease|contagious]]. The rust-colored bands are caused by a [[cyanobacterium]], but it is unknown whether this organism actually causes the disease.<ref>{{cite journal

===Collaboration with other organisms===
In addition to hosting photosynthesizing endosymbionts,<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Porifera" /> sponges are noted for their wide range of collaborations with other organisms. The relatively large encrusting sponge ''[[Lissodendoryx]] colombiensis'' is most common on rocky surfaces, but has extended its range into [[seagrass]] meadows by letting itself be surrounded or overgrown by seagrass sponges, which are distasteful to the local [[starfish]] and therefore protect ''Lissodendoryx'' against them; in return the seagrass sponges get higher positions away from the sea-floor sediment.<ref>{{cite journal

24-isopropyl[[cholestane]] is a stable derivative of 24-isopropyl[[cholesterol]], which is thought to be produced by [[demosponge]]s but not by [[eumetazoa]]ns ("true animals", i.e. [[cnidaria]]ns and [[bilateria]]ns). Since [[choanoflagellate]]s are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the [[biochemistry]] and [[gene]]s of one [[choanoflagellate]] species.

In the 1990s sponges were widely regarded as a [[monophyletic]] group, in other words all of them descended from a common ancestor that was itself a sponge, and as the "sister-group" to all other [[metazoa]]ns (multi-celled animals), which themselves form a monophyletic group. On the other hand some 1990s analyses also revived the idea that animals' nearest evolutionary relatives are [[choanoflagellate]]s, single-celled organisms very similar to sponges' [[choanocytes]] – which would imply that most Metazoa evolved from very sponge-like ancestors and therefore that sponges may not be monophyletic, as the same sponge-like ancestors may have given rise both to modern sponges and to non-sponge members of Metazoa.<ref name="BorchielliniManuelEtAl2001SpongeParaphylyAndOriginOfMetazoa">{{cite journal

Analyses since 2001 have concluded that [[Eumetazoa]] (more complex than sponges) are more closely related to particular groups of sponges than to the rest of the sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of [[ribosome]] [[DNA]] concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between [[glass sponge]]s and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more closely related to [[Calcarea|Calcareous sponges]], those with [[calcium carbonate]] [[spicule]]s, than to other types of sponge.<ref name="BorchielliniManuelEtAl2001SpongeParaphylyAndOriginOfMetazoa" /> In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of [[RNA]] and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are more closely related to each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are more closely related to Eumetazoa.<ref name="MüllerLiEtAl2007UniqueSkeletonOfSiliceousSponges" /><ref>{{cite journal

Other anatomical and biochemical evidence links the Eumetazoa with [[Homoscleromorpha]], a sub-group of demosponges. A comparison in 2007 of [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[DNA]], excluding glass sponges and [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]], concluded that: [[Homoscleromorpha]] are most closely related to Eumetazoa; calcareous sponges are the next closest; the other demosponges are evolutionary "aunts" of these groups; and the [[chancelloriidae|chancelloriids]], bag-like animals whose fossils are found in [[Cambrian]] rocks, may be sponges.<ref name="SperlingPeterson2007PoriferanParaphyly">{{cite journal

The analyses described above concluded that sponges are closest to the ancestors of all Metazoa, in other words of all multi-celled animals including both sponges and more complex groups. However, another comparison in 2008 of 150 genes in each of 21 genera, ranging from fungi to humans but including only two species of sponge, suggested that [[ctenophora|comb jellies]] ([[ctenophora]]) are the most basal lineage of the Metazoa included in the sample. If this is correct, either modern comb jellies developed their complex structures independently of other Metazoa, or sponges' ancestors were more complex and all known sponges are drastically simplified forms. The study recommended further analyses using a wider range of sponges and other simple Metazoa such as [[Placozoa]].<ref name=class>{{cite journal

It is difficult to fit chancelloriids into classifications of sponges or more complex animals.

===Basal lineage?===
Sponges are among the simplest [[animals]]. They lack [[Gastrulation|gastrulated embryos]], [[Gastrointestinal tract|extracellular digestive cavities]], [[nerve]]s, [[muscle]]s, [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, and obvious sensory structures, features possessed by all other animals. In addition, sponge [[choanocyte]]s (feeding cells) appear to be a homologous to [[choanoflagellate]]s, a group of unicellular and colonial protists that are believed to be the immediate precursors of animals. The traditional conclusion is that sponges are the basal lineage of the animals, and that features such as tissues developed after sponges and other animals diverged. Sponges were first assigned their own subkingdom, the [[Parazoa]], but more recent molecular studies suggested that the sponges were [[paraphyletic]] to other animals, with the eumetazoa as a sister group to the most derived:<ref name=Sperling2007>{{cite journal

The [[calcium carbonate]] or [[silica]] [[spicule]]s of most sponge [[genus|genera]] make them too rough for most uses, but two genera, ''[[Hippospongia]]'' and ''[[Spongia]]'', have soft, entirely fibrous skeletons. Early Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes, including padding for helmets, portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters. Until the invention of synthetic sponges, they were used as cleaning tools, applicators for paints and [[ceramic glaze]]s and discreet [[contraceptive]]s. However by the mid-20th century, over-fishing brought both the animals and the industry close to extinction.<ref>{{cite book

====Other biologically active compounds====
Lacking any protective shell or means of escape, sponges have evolved to synthesize a variety of unusual compounds. One such class is the oxidized fatty acid derivatives called [[oxylipin]]s. Members of this family have been found to have anti-cancer, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. One example isolated from the Okinawan ''plakortis'' sponges, plakoridine A, has shown potential as a cytotoxin to murine lymphoma cells.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Organic Chemistry|year=1994|volume=59|pages=3712–3713|doi=10.1021/jo00092a039|title=Plakoridine A, a new tyramine-containing pyrrolidine alkaloid from the ''Okinawan marine'' sponge Plakortis sp|last1=Takeuchi|first1=Shinji|last2=Ishibashi|first2=Masami|last3=Kobayashi|first3=Junichi|issue=13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Etchells|first=L|coauthors=Sardarian A., Whitehead R.

'''Sun Studio''' is a recording studio opened by rock-and-roll pioneer [[Sam Phillips]] at 706 Union Avenue in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], on January 3, 1950. It was originally called '''Memphis Recording Service''', sharing the same building with the [[Sun Records]] label business. Reputedly the first [[rock and roll]] single, Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats' "[[Rocket 88]]" was recorded there in 1951 with song composer [[Ike Turner]] on keyboards, leading the studio to claim status as the birthplace of rock & roll. [[Blues]] and [[R&B]] artists like [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Junior Parker]], [[Little Milton]], [[B.B. King]], [[James Cotton]], [[Rufus Thomas]], and [[Rosco Gordon]] recorded there in the early 1950s.

[[Rock and roll]], [[country music]], and [[rockabilly]] artists, including [[Johnny Cash]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Charlie Feathers]], [[Ray Harris]], [[Warren Smith (singer)|Warren Smith]], [[Charlie Rich]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], recorded there throughout the mid-to-late 1950s until the studio outgrew its Union Avenue location. Sam Phillips opened the larger Sam C. Phillips Recording Studio, better known as [[Phillips Recording]], in 1959 to replace the older facility. Since Phillips had invested in the Holiday Inn Hotel chain earlier, he also recorded artists starting in 1963 on the label [[Holiday Inn Records]] for [[Kemmons Wilson]]. In 1957, [[Bill Justis]] recorded his [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] song "[[Raunchy (song)|Raunchy]]" for Sam Phillips and worked as a musical director at Sun Records.

In 1969, Sam Phillips sold the label to Shelby Singleton, and there was no recording-related or label-related activity again in the building until the September 1985 ''[[Class of '55]]'' recording sessions with Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash, produced by [[Chips Moman]].

In 1987, the original building housing the Sun Records label and Memphis Recording Service was reopened by Gary Hardy as "Sun Studio," a recording label and tourist attraction that has attracted many notable artists, such as [[U2]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], and [[Ringo Starr]].

In 2005, [[Brian Setzer]] (of Stray Cats fame) released his ''Rockabilly Riot Vol. 1: A Tribute To Sun Records'' album. Although not recorded at Sun it did feature various Sun Records recordings including some hits and other more obscure songs. In 2007, Canadian rockabilly band the Kingmakers recorded a selection of originals and classics such as Elvis Presley's "That's All Right" at Sun Studio, released as their first CD "Live at SUN Studio". In May 2009, Canadian blues artist [[JW-Jones]] recorded with blues legend [[Hubert Sumlin]], [[Larry Taylor]] and [[Richard Innes]] for his 2010 release at the studio. In July 2009, [[John Mellencamp]] recorded nine songs for his album ''[[No Better Than This]]'' at the studio. In 2011, [[Chris Isaak]] released "Beyond the Sun," a collection of songs recorded at Sun Studio, most of which are cover versions of songs originally released on Sun Records.

==Beginnings and Phillips Records==
[[Image:Sunoffice2005.jpg|thumb|right|The front office of the Sun Studio, where office manager [[Marion Keisker]] worked and greeted many artists on their first visit to the studio, including a young [[Elvis Presley]].]]
In January 1950, [[WREC]] radio engineer Sam Phillips opened the Memphis Recording Service at 706 Union Avenue with his assistant and long-time friend, [[Marion Keisker]].<ref name=Victor399>Victor, pp. 399</ref> Phillips had dreamed of opening his own recording studio since he was a young man, and now that it was a reality he was overjoyed. However, getting the company off the ground was not an easy task. To create revenue at the beginning, Phillips would record conventions, weddings, choirs, and even funerals. He also held an open door policy, allowing anybody to walk in and, for a small fee, record their own record. Phillips' slogan for his studio was "We Record Anything, Anywhere, Anytime."<ref name=Victor399/> In June, Phillips and a friend, local DJ [[Dewey Phillips]] who was no relation, set up their own record label called Phillips Records.<ref name=Day8>Guralnick/Jorgensen, pp. 8</ref> The purpose of the label was to record "negro artists of the South" who wanted to make a recording but had no place to do so. The label failed to make an impact and folded after just one release; "Boogie in the Park" by [[Joe Hill Louis]], which sold less than 400 copies.<ref name=AZ153>Worth/Tamerius, pp. 153</ref>

After the failure of Phillips Records, Phillips began working closely with other record labels such as [[Chess Records]] and [[Modern Records]], providing demo recordings for them and recording master tapes for their artists.<ref name=AZ153/> It was during this time that Phillips recorded what many consider to be the first rock and roll song, [[Jackie Brenston]]'s "[[Rocket 88]]".<ref name=Victor399/> Some biographers have suggested that it was Phillips' inventive creativeness that led to the songs unique sound, but others put it down to the fact that the amplifier used on the record was broken, leading to a "fuzzy" sound.<ref name=AZ153/> The Sun Studio tour lends credence to the latter, with the tour guide saying the amplifier was stuffed with wads of newspaper.

==Sun Records==
In early 1952, Phillips once again launched his own record label, this time calling it Sun Records.<ref name=Victor399/> During his first year he recorded several artists who would go on to have successful careers. Among them were [[B.B. King]], Joe Hill Louis, [[Rufus Thomas]], and [[Howlin' Wolf]]. Despite the number of singers who recorded there, Phillips found it increasingly difficult to keep profits up. He reportedly drove over 60,000 miles in one year to promote his artists with radio stations and distributors. To keep costs down, he would pay his artists 3% [[royalties]] instead of the usual 5% that was more common at the time. Phillips turned to [[alcohol]] when it looked like his label would once again fail, and he was put into a [[mental hospital]] at one point, reportedly getting [[electric shock treatment]].<ref name=Victor399/>

Rufus Thomas' "Bearcat", a recording that was similar to "[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]", was the first real hit for Sun in 1953. Although the song was the label's first hit, a copyright-infringement suit ensued and nearly bankrupted Phillips' record label.<ref>Victor, pp. 50</ref> Despite this, Phillips was able to keep his business afloat by recording several other acts, including [[the Prisonaires]]; a black quartet who were given permission to leave prison in June 1953 to record their single, "Just Walkin' in the Rain", later a hit for [[Johnnie Ray]] in 1956.<ref>Victor, pp. 424</ref> The song was a big enough hit that the local newspaper took an interest in the story of its recording. A few biographers have said that this article, printed in the ''[[Memphis Press-Scimitar]]'' on July 15, influenced Elvis Presley to seek out Sun to record a demo record.<ref>Guralnick/Jorgensen, p.12</ref>

==Elvis Presley==
In August 1953, fresh out of his high school graduation the previous June, the 18½ year old Presley walked into the offices of Sun. He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided [[acetate disc]]: "[[My Happiness (country song)|My Happiness]]" and "That's When Your Heartaches Begin". He would later claim he intended the record as a gift for his mother, or was merely interested in what he "sounded like", though there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer [[Peter Guralnick]] argues that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist [[Marion Keisker]] what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, "I sing all kinds." When she pressed him on whom he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, "I don't sound like nobody." After he recorded, Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: "Good ballad singer. Hold."<ref>Guralnick, 1994, pp. 62–64</ref> Presley cut a second acetate in January 1954—"I'll Never Stand In Your Way" and "It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You"—but again nothing came of it.<ref>Guralnick, 1994, p. 65</ref>

Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused to a broader audience. As Keisker reported, "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'"<ref>Miller, 2000, p. 72</ref> In June, he acquired a demo recording of a ballad, "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenaged singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist [[Scotty Moore|Winfield "Scotty" Moore]] and [[double bass|upright bass]] player [[Bill Black]], to work something up with Presley for a recording session.<ref>Jorgensen, 1998, pp. 10–11</ref>

The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1949 blues number, Arthur Crudup's "[[That's All Right]]". Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open ... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try to find a place to start, and do it again.'" Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=94–97}} Three days later, popular Memphis DJ [[Dewey Phillips]] played "That's All Right" on his ''Red, Hot, and Blue'' show.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=43}} Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100–1}} During the next few days the trio recorded a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] number, [[Bill Monroe]]'s "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]", again in a distinctive style and employing a jury-rigged [[Delay (audio effect)|echo effect]] that Sam Phillips dubbed "slapback". A single was pressed with "That's All Right" on the A side and "Blue Moon of Kentucky" on the reverse.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=102–4}}

===Selling Presley===
Within months Phillips saw his label expand significantly owing to the number of Presley records sold. Radio stations and record stores all over the South were eager to play them, and as Presley's profile grew over the next year, Phillips realized Sun was not large enough to break him throughout the United States. In February 1955, Phillips met with [[Colonel Tom Parker]], a man known for his hustling skills as well as his managerial ones. Parker persuaded Phillips that Presley needed a national record label to help him further his career, and after several more months Phillips agreed to sell Presley's contract.<ref name=Victor399/> He told Parker that he would require a $5,000 down-payment by November 15, as an advance on a $35,000 buy out fee. At the time, $35,000 was an unheard of amount of money for a recording artist's contract, especially one who had yet to prove himself on the national stage.<ref name=Victor399/>

Although Presley didn't want to leave Sun, according to Sun engineer Jack Clement, Phillips sold his contract because he needed the money to settle debts and pay off costs still associated with Rufus Thomas's "Bearcat" copyright-infringement suit.<ref name=Victor399/> Phillips, however, insisted that he only offered Presley's contract for $35,000 because he believed it would put off any other record label from purchasing it. Regardless, Presley signed a record contract with [[RCA Victor]] in November 1955, and left Sun. Phillips used some of the money to further advance the careers of his other artists, by now featuring [[Johnny Cash]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and [[Roy Orbison]].

===Million Dollar Quartet===
{{see also|Million Dollar Quartet}}
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2013}}
On December 4, 1956 an [[impromptu]] [[jam session]] among [[Elvis Presley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Carl Perkins]], and [[Johnny Cash]] took place at Sun Studio.
The jam session seems to have happened by pure chance. Perkins, who by this time had already met success with "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]", had come into the studio that day, accompanied by his brothers Clayton and Jay and by drummer [[W.S. Holland]], their aim being to cut some new material, including a revamped version of an old blues song, "[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]". Phillips, who wished to try to fatten this sparse rockabilly instrumentation, had brought in his latest acquisition, singer and piano man extraordinaire [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], still unknown outside Memphis, to play piano on the Perkins session.

Sometime in the early afternoon, Presley dropped in to pay a casual visit accompanied by a girlfriend, Marilyn Evans.<ref>{{Citation | last = George | first = Jason | title = How the Tribune tracked her down | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | pages = Live!, page 4 | date = 2008-11-11 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/doc/420798196.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+11%2C+2008&author=George%2C+Jason&pub=Chicago+Tribune&edition=&startpage=&desc=Elvis+mystery+solved! | nopp = true}}</ref>  He was, at the time, the biggest name in show business, having hit the top of the singles charts five times, and topping the album charts twice in the preceding 12-month period. Less than four months earlier, he had appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', pulling an unheard-of 83% of the television audience, which was estimated at 55 million, the largest in history up to that time.

After chatting with Philips in the control room, Presley listened to the playback of Perkins’ session, which he pronounced to be good. Then he went out into the studio and some time later the jam session began. At some point during the session, Sun artist [[Johnny Cash]], who had recently enjoyed a few hits on the country charts, popped in. (Cash wrote in his autobiography ''Cash'' that he had been first to arrive at the Sun Studio that day, wanting to listen in on the Perkins recording session.) [[Jack Clement|Cowboy Jack Clement]] was engineering that day and remembers saying to himself "I think I'd be remiss not to record this" and so he did. After running through a number of songs, Elvis and girlfriend Evans slipped out as Jerry Lee pounded away on the piano. Cash claims in ''Cash'' that "no one wanted to follow Jerry Lee, not even Elvis."

During the session Phillips spotted an opportunity for some publicity and called a local newspaper, the ''Memphis Press-Scimitar''. Bob Johnson, the newspaper’s entertainment editor, came over to the studio accompanied by a [[UPI]] representative named Leo Soroca and a photographer.

The following day, an article, written by Johnson about the session, was published in the ''Memphis Press-Scimitar'' under the title "[[Million Dollar Quartet]]". The article contained the now-famous photograph of Presley seated at the piano surrounded by Lewis, Perkins and Cash (the uncropped version of the photo also includes Evans, shown seated atop the piano). This photo proves Cash was there, but the audio doesn't provide substantial proof he joined in on the session.

==Decline==
For several years after Presley left Sun, Phillips had success with other acts. Sun Studio became known as a place that nurtured talent and then encouraged it to expand with bigger labels. In 1959, Phillips moved Sun Studio to larger premises at 639 Madison Avenue. By the mid 1960s, Phillips had lost interest in recording and had instead branched out into radio. He opened several radio stations, beginning in the late 1950s, and Sun lost its reputation as an innovative recording studio. In 1968, Sun released its last record. In 1969, [[Mercury Records]] label producer [[Shelby Singleton]] &ndash; noted for producing the [[Ray Stevens]]' [[hit single|hit]] "[[Ahab the Arab]]" in 1962, and later Jeannie C. Riley's 1968 hit single "[[Harper Valley PTA]]" on his Nashville-based [[Plantation Records]] label &ndash; purchased the Sun label from Phillips. Singleton merged his operations into Sun International Corporation, which re-released and re-packaged compilations of Sun's early artists in the early 1970s. Singleton moved the firm to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and sold the building to a plumbing company, who eventually sold it to an auto parts store.<ref>Worth/Tamerius, p. 191</ref>

Since, Sun Records Studio has been used as a setting for the film biopics ''[[Walk the Line]]'', ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire]]'', ''[[Mystery Train (film)|Mystery Train]]'' and ''[[Elvis (TV miniseries)|Elvis]]''.

==Re-opening==
In 1987, ten years after Presley died, Sun Studio at 706 Union Avenue was converted back into a recording studio, and soon became a tourist attraction for Presley fans and music lovers in general. The studio was also used by several well known acts to record, including [[U2]], [[Def Leppard]], John Mellencamp, the Bogus Bros. and Chris Isaak & Silvertone to name a few. In 2003 it was officially recognized as a [[National Historic Landmark]] tourist attraction.<ref>Victor, p. 508</ref>

Sun Studio regularly releases studio session [[podcasts]] on YouTube and on Public Television. Sun Studio have announced that [[PBS]] affiliate stations will be showing a 30-minute series of ''Sun Studio Sessions'' starting in January 2010.
